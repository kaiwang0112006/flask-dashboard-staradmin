### [Flask Framework](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

[Flask](/what-is/flask) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## [What is dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

In information technology, a **[dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))** is a user interface that, somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard - by [Techtarget](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/dashboard)
